                            At Destiny Shelter, we believe that every military member deserves recognition for their service, and what better way to show our appreciation than by offering a special discount on pet adoptions. Military personnel receive a 20% discount when adopting a dog or any other pet from our shelter. It's our way of giving back to those who have served, helping them find a loyal companion while easing the adoption process. At Destiny Shelter, we're committed to supporting our heroes and ensuring they find the perfect pet to share their journey with.
