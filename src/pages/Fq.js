            longContent="Your $300-$600 adoption fee includes spay/neuter, microchip, and vaccines current to the age of the dog/puppy . If you adopt a animal under 6 months old, an additional $50 training deposit will be required and refunded once your animal has completed training before the 6-month mark. This is to ensure all of our puppies are set up for success in their new homes."

            longContent="Unfortunately, many dogs that we save entered the shelter as strays or were surrendered by their owners with little or no information. We do our best to include any information about their history in their profile if it is known. Otherwise, we will always report information about their personalities and health and training based on how theyâ€™ve done in our program."

                    medical bills, training, food, and other costs to care for dogs in need. Each rescued dog costs an average of $500."
